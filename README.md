About Dataset


Being collected and published in 2008, the Forest Fires dataset is a great summation of the climate in Portugalsâ€™ forest regions. It includes various attributes which are highly detailed, and the purpose of this dataset is to potentially influence and/or predict forest fires, including meteorological data and special information. A few of the noteworthy features include area, temperature, FDI, rain, DMC, coordinates of fires and much more. With over 20 columns to combine and choose from, it creates possibilities for a deeper analysis of the dataset using data integration practices. 

this project demonstrates the application of Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark in analyzing the "forestfires.csv" dataset to understand and predict forest fire occurrences. By following a structured approach to data preprocessing, integration, and advanced analytics, valuable insights have been derived that can inform forest management policies, improve firefighting strategies, and contribute to environmental sustainability efforts. The comprehensive documentation and GitHub repository provide transparency in the project's methodology, findings, and implementation details, ensuring reproducibility and scalability in similar environmental studies.

Through this project, we not only enhance technical skills in big data analytics but also contribute to addressing critical environmental challenges, emphasizing the importance of data-driven approaches in mitigating the impact of forest fires.
